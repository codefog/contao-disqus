disqus Contao Extension
=======================

Use the DISQUS comment system on your Contao website. You can use it as front end module or content element. All you need to launch is the "shortname" identifier of the comments thread - it is an autogenerated value in the DISQUS administrator panel.

You can also initialize the comment system anywhere in your system (e.g. template files) by using the code below:

```php
<?php echo Disqus::generateComments('my_shortname'); ?>
```
